            <h1>Dungeons and Dragons Character Info</h1>
            <p>The Atmorian Military revere the great bow. There is true safety in range. 
				But they fear a true Lancer. A sharp strike, vorpal thrust, strength enough to fell a beast. 
				Estinien cleaves the battlefield, pierces the heart of the enemy, ruptures the plaguing monsters. The lance makes the way clear... the arrows follow. 
				Melee is for the fearless, the truly perfect warrior. But Estinien is restrained, he doubtful of the ideal of death, and instead ponders the ideal of
				life. He has seen what he has offered war, but now wishes to see what war offers him. A chance for... Adventure? Prestige? No, instead a chance make a difference in the world. Skill offered to the people he protects.

                <p>I can stare down a hell hound without flinching. I've lost too many friends, and I'm slow to make new ones.
					I do what I must and obey just authority. Ideals aren't worth killing over or going to war for.
					I'd rather eat my armor than admit when I'm wrong.

                <h3>Voltaic Lance of Faith </h3>
                <p>Whenever the bearer deals damage to a creature, this weapon gains a charge. As a bonus action, the bearer can use any number of charges to deal that much extra
					lightning damage on their next attack. If a round (6 seconds) goes by and the weapon has not struck a foe, it loses all charges. When the bearer of this item rolls
					hit dice, they can choose to re-roll them and take the second result.
